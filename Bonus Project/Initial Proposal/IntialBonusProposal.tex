What I want to do with my project is to induce voltage in coil by rotating a coil with current in it. The idea is to construct two coils from winding up copper wire. One of the coils will be connected to a voltage source and resistor in series to allow current through it. This coil will be rotated near the other coil. This means the current in the primary coil will be constantly changing relative to the secondary coil. which will be connected to either a voltmeter or an LED to show that there has been a voltage induced in the secondary coil through an electromagnetic field.
